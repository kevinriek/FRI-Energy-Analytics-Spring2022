# FRI: Energy-Analytics Spring 2022 Project

This is the repository for my Spring 2022 Energy Analytics course (under UT's Freshman Research Initiative) project. Myself and Sashank Meka worked on this project,
with the supervision of Jose Hernandez. In this project, we performed Time Series analysis of Oil Well Production using the DeepAR model, using South Dakotan 
well data.

Note: this is a copy of the original repository, which is private.
